# sokil_code
This is a repository for the 25-26 Sokil clinic forked from the remote repository for the 24-25 Sokil Clinic team. There are two additional branches for this repository:
- *LVX_parser*: A shelved effort to create a parser for the custom LVX file type. The current code implementation works (can fully parse data from the Livox Avia including timestamps, IMU vs. LiDAR info, and header information), but has not been used.
- *obj_dect*: A directory containing information on the current pursued object detection algorithms.

As per last clinic's documentation style, further info about each branch will be included in an associated README.
